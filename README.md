# Social Media Avatar and Banner Manager - Browser Extension Design Document

## 1. Introduction

This design document outlines the development of a browser extension that allows users to update their avatar and banner images across multiple social media platforms from a single source. The purpose of this document is to provide a detailed overview of the extension's architecture, components, and technologies used in the development.

## 2. System Architecture

The browser extension will be built using standard web technologies, such as HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript, to provide a user-friendly interface for managing avatar and banner images. It will utilize client-side libraries for OAuth authentication, image manipulation, and API communication.

### 2.1 User Interface

The extension will have a popup UI that allows users to upload their avatar and banner images, manage their social media platform integrations, and access image cropping and resizing tools. The UI will be built using HTML5 and CSS3, with JavaScript handling user interactions and data management.

### 2.2 OAuth Authentication

The browser extension will implement OAuth authentication for each supported social media platform using client-side OAuth libraries. These libraries will handle the authentication flow, token management, and API calls on the client-side.

### 2.3 Image Manipulation

Image cropping and resizing will be performed using client-side libraries like Cropper.js or Pica. These libraries can handle image manipulation tasks directly in the browser without the need for a backend server.

### 2.4 API Communication

The browser extension will communicate with social media platform APIs using JavaScript. It will leverage the platform's JavaScript SDKs or use standard AJAX techniques for making API calls to update avatar and banner images.

### 2.5 Data Storage

User data, such as API tokens and image metadata, will be stored locally on the user's device using browser storage options like LocalStorage or IndexedDB.

## 3. Browser Compatibility

The browser extension should be compatible with popular web browsers like Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, and Microsoft Edge. To achieve cross-browser compatibility, the extension's code and manifest files may need to be adjusted accordingly.

## 4. Development Process

The development process can be divided into the following steps:

1. **Design the UI**: Create wireframes and mockups for the browser extension's popup UI. Plan out the layout and styling for the image upload, social media platform integration, and image editing sections.
2. **Implement OAuth authentication**: Choose appropriate client-side OAuth libraries for each supported social media platform and integrate them into the extension. Implement the authentication flow and token management for each platform.
3. **Develop image manipulation functionality**: Integrate a client-side image manipulation library, like Cropper.js or Pica, to provide image cropping and resizing tools. Implement the user interface for these tools within the popup UI.
4. **Integrate API communication**: Implement API communication with the supported social media platforms using JavaScript. Leverage the platform's JavaScript SDKs or AJAX techniques to make API calls and update avatar and banner images.
5. **Implement data storage**: Set up local storage for user data using browser storage options like LocalStorage or IndexedDB. Implement data management functions to store and retrieve user data, such as API tokens and image metadata.
6. **Test the extension**: Thoroughly test the extension across different browsers and platforms, ensuring it functions correctly and handles edge cases gracefully.
7. **Package and distribute**: Package the extension for distribution on popular browser extension stores, such as the Chrome Web Store, Mozilla Add-ons, and Microsoft Edge Add-ons.

Following these steps will help you develop a browser extension that enables users to manage their avatars and banners across multiple social media platforms securely and seamlessly.
