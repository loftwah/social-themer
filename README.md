# Social Media Avatar and Banner Manager - Browser Extension Design Document

## 1. Introduction

This design document outlines the development of a browser extension that allows users to update their avatar and banner images across multiple social media platforms from a single source. The purpose of this document is to provide a detailed overview of the extension's architecture, components, and technologies used in the development.

## 2. System Architecture

The browser extension will be built using standard web technologies, such as HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript, to provide a user-friendly interface for managing avatar and banner images. It will utilize client-side libraries for OAuth authentication, image manipulation, and API communication.

### 2.1 User Interface

The extension will have a popup UI that allows users to upload their avatar and banner images, manage their social media platform integrations, and access image cropping and resizing tools. The UI will be built using HTML5 and CSS3, with JavaScript handling user interactions and data management.

### 2.2 OAuth Authentication

The browser extension will implement OAuth authentication for each supported social media platform using client-side OAuth libraries. These libraries will handle the authentication flow, token management, and API calls on the client-side.

### 2.3 Image Manipulation

Image cropping and resizing will be performed using client-side libraries like Cropper.js or Pica. These libraries can handle image manipulation tasks directly in the browser without the need for a backend server.

### 2.4 API Communication

The browser extension will communicate with social media platform APIs using JavaScript. It will leverage the platform's JavaScript SDKs or use standard AJAX techniques for making API calls to update avatar and banner images.

### 2.5 Data Storage

User data, such as API tokens and image metadata, will be stored locally on the user's device using browser storage options like LocalStorage or IndexedDB.

## 3. Browser Compatibility

The browser extension should be compatible with popular web browsers like Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, and Microsoft Edge. To achieve cross-browser compatibility, the extension's code and manifest files may need to be adjusted accordingly.

## 4. Development Process

The development process can be divided into the following steps:

1. **Design the UI**: Create wireframes and mockups for the browser extension's popup UI. Plan out the layout and styling for the image upload, social media platform integration, and image editing sections.
2. **Implement OAuth authentication**: Choose appropriate client-side OAuth libraries for each supported social media platform and integrate them into the extension. Implement the authentication flow and token management for each platform.
3. **Develop image manipulation functionality**: Integrate a client-side image manipulation library, like Cropper.js or Pica, to provide image cropping and resizing tools. Implement the user interface for these tools within the popup UI.
4. **Integrate API communication**: Implement API communication with the supported social media platforms using JavaScript. Leverage the platform's JavaScript SDKs or AJAX techniques to make API calls and update avatar and banner images.
5. **Implement data storage**: Set up local storage for user data using browser storage options like LocalStorage or IndexedDB. Implement data management functions to store and retrieve user data, such as API tokens and image metadata.
6. **Test the extension**: Thoroughly test the extension across different browsers and platforms, ensuring it functions correctly and handles edge cases gracefully.
7. **Package and distribute**: Package the extension for distribution on popular browser extension stores, such as the Chrome Web Store, Mozilla Add-ons, and Microsoft Edge Add-ons.

Following these steps will help you develop a browser extension that enables users to manage their avatars and banners across multiple social media platforms securely and seamlessly.

## UI

Designing the UI for the browser extension's popup involves creating wireframes and mockups to visualize the layout, structure, and user interactions for the image upload, social media platform integration, and image editing sections. This process helps guide the development of the extension and ensures a user-friendly and intuitive experience.

1. Wireframes
Wireframes are simple, low-fidelity sketches that outline the layout and structure of the popup UI. They help to establish the basic organization of the interface and identify the core components and user interactions.

1.1 Components
The main components of the popup UI include:

Image upload section: This section allows users to upload their avatar and banner images. It should include two file input fields (one for the avatar and another for the banner) and image previews.

Social media platform integration section: This section enables users to connect and manage their social media accounts. It should display a list of supported platforms (e.g., Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, LinkedIn) with buttons or toggles to connect or disconnect each account.

Image editing section: This section provides image cropping and resizing tools. It should include a cropping area, aspect ratio selection, zoom controls, and a preview of the edited image.

Update Images button: A prominent button to apply the changes and update the avatar and banner images across all connected social media platforms.

1.2 Layout
A possible layout for the popup UI can be divided into three sections, stacked vertically:

The image upload section at the top.
The social media platform integration section in the middle.
The image editing section at the bottom.
The Update Images button should be placed at the bottom of the popup UI, below the image editing section.

2. Mockups
Mockups are higher-fidelity representations of the popup UI that incorporate visual design elements, such as colors, typography, and icons. They help to refine the look and feel of the interface and provide a closer representation of the final product.

2.1 Visual Design
Colors: Choose a color scheme that is consistent with the extension's branding and provides good contrast for readability. Consider using neutral colors for the background and more vibrant colors for buttons and accents.

Typography: Select a clean and legible font for the text elements in the popup UI. Ensure that font sizes and line heights are appropriate for easy readability.

Icons: Use icons to represent social media platforms and common actions, such as connecting accounts, cropping, and zooming. Choose icons that are visually consistent and easily recognizable.

2.2 Responsive Design
Ensure that the popup UI is responsive and adapts to different screen sizes and resolutions. This includes scaling the text, images, and interface elements to provide an optimal user experience on various devices.

With wireframes and mockups in place, the design process for the browser extension's popup UI should provide a solid foundation for the development of a user-friendly and visually appealing interface.
